⚙️ Data Formats
The application relies on two primary CSV files for event and attendee data.

attendees.csv
Column	Description	Example	Notes
Name	Attendee full name	"Alex Chen"	Required
Email	Contact email address	"alex@corp.com"	Used for communications
Interests	Semicolon-separated topics	"AI;SaaS;Growth"	Critical for Personalized Reminders
Registered_Event	The event they signed up for	"AI for Startups 2024"	Links to events.csv
Attended	Attendance status	"Yes" or "No"	Updated post-event

Export to Sheets
events.csv
(Assumed structure based on app logic, add columns as needed)

Column	Description	Example
Event_ID	Unique identifier for the event	E-001
Event_Name	Full name of the event	"AI for Startups 2024"
Date	Event date	2025-10-15
Topic	Primary focus area	"AI & Machine Learning"

Export to Sheets
🎯 Key Application Sections
📊 Dashboard
The central hub for data visualization. Monitor Key Metrics (Attendance Rate, Total Registered), analyze Event Summary breakdowns, and interact with live Visual Analytics powered by Plotly.

📧 Pre- & Post-Event Communications
Segment attendees for maximum impact:

Personalized Reminders: Craft messages based on Interests from attendees.csv.

No-show Re-engagement: Automated campaigns with special offers to convert missed attendees.

Bulk Operations: Export all generated email templates for easy sending via your own ESP.

💡 Insights & Analytics
Go beyond simple numbers. Use the Interest Analysis to inform future content strategy and the Event Performance metrics to compare attendance rates and ROI across different events.

🎮 Gamification Engine
Leverage gamification_engine.py to add a layer of fun:

Track participation via user_activities.json.

Assign points for actions (Q&A submission, resource download).

Use the data to segment and reward your most engaged attendees.

🛠️ Customization & Extensibility
The modular architecture makes this project easily adaptable to your specific needs.

Modify Templates: All communication templates are easily editable within app.py or can be externalized for easier management.

Enhance AI: Modify ai_components.py to add new features like automated resource summarization or personalized topic recommendations.

Add New Data Sources: Easily integrate with other event platforms (e.g., Eventbrite, Zoom) by creating new data loading functions.

🚀 Future Roadmap
Direct Email Integration: Connecting to popular ESPs (SendGrid, Mailchimp) for in-app sending.

Advanced Segmentation: Using machine learning to predict attendance and segment high-risk attendees.

A/B Testing Module: Built-in functionality for testing message templates and subject lines.

CI/CD Pipeline: Streamlining deployment for production environments.
